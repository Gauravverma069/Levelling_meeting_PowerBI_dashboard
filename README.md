# Levelling_meeting_PowerBI_dashboard
PowerBI Dashboard made for levelling meeting in corporation for interdepartmental meeting to showcase the performance of different department.
While i was working as PPC coordinator for BOSCH, Jaipur. levelling meeting use to happen on excel spreadsheet which were very untidy and visually unappealing,
for resolving the problem for making it tidy and visually appealing,I was tasked to creat a PowerBI dashboard,
which contains daily output of our 4 different departments,comparing to target output,
also containing Heatmap, OPL(open point list), Customer Critial,(VBL) Vender backlog, assembly Losses.
